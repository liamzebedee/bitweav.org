## Introduction
The communications space is based on centralised and propietary infrastructures. There are two reasons for this: **simplicity** and **profit**.

### Simplicity
Simplicity requires a centralised infrastructure because it is inherently more complex to build a decentralised network. The key principle behind this centralised infrastructure is that of least practicality: "Centralised protocols fulfil what functionality decentralised and peer-to-peer protocols cannot".

No-one believed it would've been possible to create a decentralised and peer-to-peer currency like Bitcoin. 

No-one believed it would've been possible to create a decentralised and peer-to-peer YouTube like Tribler.  

But it was possible, and it happened because of persistent and focused effort.

### Profit
The other reason is profit. Organisations naturally have an incentive to build a propietary communicatons network, so that they may profit from it and thus sustain their operations.

For these reasons, centralisation, and its subsequent flaws, is prominent today. But this can, and should, be changed.

Rather than basing our communications on something centralised, and then trying to improve on its flaws (censorship, scalability, concerns as to security etc.), why not turn the system upside down and base the core on a decentralised system, and then improve the quality of service using centralised systems.

The bottom-up approach of starting decentralised and building centralised enhancements on top of it proves to be more sustainable than the existing infrastructure.

## Organisation
A solution requires persistent and focused effort, something that is attained using organisation.

Our **mission** is to build a simple, sustainable and secure communications platform for all to use freely.

Our **vision** is a future wherein we rely on a decentralised core infrastructure for communications.
