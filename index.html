<div id="about">
<h2><a href="/#about">About</a></h2>
<p>BitWeav is a project to build the premier decentralised P2P microblogging alternative; a P2P Twitter. It is a fully-fledged design (read the <a href="/whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a>) and a work-in-progress application (see the <a href="https://github.com/bitweav/bitweavd">code</a>).</p>

<p>Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completely decentralised and P2P
<li>Cryptographically authenticated micropublishing
<li>Threading mechanisms for replies and threads
<li>Categorisation using tags
<li>Multilingual support
<li>Interoperable with other applications through URLs
<li>Uses a <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~spyros/papers/PolderCast.pdf" title="PolderCast">scalable publish-subscribe overlay network design</a> that doesn't require rendez-vous nodes for topics (meaning only people who are interested in a topic will help distribute messages on it)
<li>Free and open-source software project
</ul>

<p>Make sure to read at least the introduction section of the <a href="/whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a> for a better overview of the project.</p>

<h2><a href="/#faqs">FAQs</a></h2>
<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<p>My name is <a href="http://liamz.co/about">Liam Edwards-Playne</a>, I'm 16 and a student at the <a href="http://qa.eq.edu.au/our-academies/science-mathematics-technology/" rel="nofollow">Queensland Academy for Science, Maths and Tech</a>. I've been programming for five years now and interested in P2P for two of those years.</p>

<h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
<p>I have many reasons for building BitWeav, but the main one is this. Researching, innovating and building something that the world has never seen before is the most spectacular thing. The idea that people might use it and I might have some small impact on the world of technology and P2P just motivates me more.</p>
<p>Aside from this, among the flurry of P2P alternatives to applications that have been established during 2013 (after Bitcoin/PRISM went mainstream), there is a large unfulfilled void where a P2P micropublishing platform should be. There have been at most only a couple of good pieces of development into this area, among them being <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/iptps09/tech/full_papers/sandler/sandler_html/" rel="nofollow">FETHR</a> and <a href="http://tent.io" rel="nofollow">Tent</a>. There is a quote that exists as my challenge: <q>Centralised protocols exist where P2P protocols can't.</q></p>

<h3>What if BitWeav fails because of no-one using it / spam / X?</h3>
<p>I'm building BitWeav because I like doing stuff like this. While it's highly unlikely that it doesn't catch on, I'm not worried because I'll have the satisfaction knowing that I've laid the foundations for future development in this area (and that to me is success).</p>

<h3>How are you implementing it?</h3>
<p>In conjunction with my friend Michael Butler, we are developing two applications for BitWeav. The first is the daemon, which will provide a language-agnostic interface to BitWeav operations through networked RPC. The other application is the official BitWeav client, a graphical interface to the BitWeav network.</p>
<p>I have chosen to develop everything under the philosophy of free and open-source software, and am hosting the entire project on <a href="http://github.com/bitweav" rel="nofollow">GitHub</a>. By making the project open-source under an open license like Apache, I think collaboration and innovation will be much easier.</p>

<h3>How much progress has been made?</h3>
<p>Currently implementation of the daemon is headed at about 20%. After the daemon is finished, the official graphical client can be built, which is a simple wrapper around it.</p>
<p>I finished the whitepaper in the holidays, but the actual project was started <time title="March 2013" class="timeago" datetime="2013-03-12T16:30:00Z">in March 2013</time>. I am a very time-constrained student, which is why it has not already been finished, but since completing the whitepaper the rate of development has picked up. The main thing I need is time and/or contributors.</p>

<h3>What can I do to help?</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Developers and hackers</dt>
<dd><p>You can help with developing bitweavd. Please read the  <a href="https://github.com/bitweav/bitweavd/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">guide for contributing</a> â€” I have tonnes of issues open on GitHub concerning features, improvements to code and such.</p></dd>
<dt>Designers and marketers</dt>
<dd><p>This website could probably do with some UX polish, and likewise so could the pitch. It's hard for people to understand the value of open-source, and even harder the value of decentralised applications. Do <a href="http://liamz.co/contact">contact me</a> if you'd like to help.</p></dd>
<!--<dt>Other people</dt>
<dd><p>While I'm not motivated by money, I do need it.</p></dd>-->
</dl>

<h3>What if people use it for bad?</h3>
<p><q>Guns don't kill people, people kill people.</q> A tool is a tool. A mason is not responsible for what his tools are used for, and neither am I. All I can say is that one does not find solutions to political problems in cryptography.</p>
