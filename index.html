    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>My name is <a href="http://liamz.co">Liam</a>, I'm an <a href="http://www.ibo.org/diploma/">iB student</a> at <a href="http://qasmt.eq.edu.au/">QASMT</a>, and have been programming for five years.</li>
        <li>I love open data, open-source and the <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/">indie web</a>. For the past six months, I've been designing a system called BitWeav to bring open micropublishing to the masses.</li>
        <li>Now I want your help, but first things first, <strong>an introduction to the problem</strong>...</li>
    </ul>
</div></section>

<section class="slide"><div>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In the last five years Twitter has demonstrated the value of micropublishing as a communications medium.</li>
        <li>Starting <strong>conversations</strong> with strangers, spreading <strong>ideas</strong> for change, and sparking revolution — all in <strong>real-time</strong>.</li>
        <li>But Twitter has some significant issues...</li>
    </ul>
</div></section>

<section class="slide"><div>
    <h2>Issues with Twitter</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Twitter network is <strong>closed</strong> and <strong>centralised</strong>. As a result of this lack of openness, users have little control over their data. The security and reliability of the service is impeded by its centralised nature.</li>
        <li>The service is <strong>corporately owned and controlled</strong> by Twitter Inc., and thus is subject to influence from governments (PRISM, censorship) and shareholders (more profit).</li>
    </ul>
</div></section>

<section class="slide"><div>
    <h2>Alternative?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There exists an alternative already called <a href="http://status.net/wiki/OStatus">OStatus</a>, an open web protocol for distributed micropublishing. OStatus builds upon a suite of other existing protocols like Atom feeds and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">PuSH hubs</a> that have become the lingua franca of open content distribution.</li>
        <li>Let's dive in and see how it works...</li>
    </ul>
</div></section>

<section class="slide"><div>
    <h2>OStatus Overview</h2>
    <img src="data/OStatus-Overview-1.png">
    <p>OStatus starts with the idea that nearly all websites have Atom feeds, so logically we should start by storing messages as a list of entries. Now this allows us to periodically get the new content of a user, but micropublishing isn't all that. It's also the way people interact...</p>
</div></section>

<section class="slide"><div>
    <h2>OStatus Overview</h2>
    <img src="data/OStatus-Overview-2.png">
    <p>So instead of a simple Atom feed, OStatus uses an open format for social activity feeds called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_Streams_(format)">ActivityStreams</a>. ActivityStreams allow us to express everything we need to follow someone's activities, however we have to repeatedly pull down the feed, which isn't realtime...</p>
</div></section>

<section class="slide"><div>
    <h2>OStatus Overview</h2>
    <img src="data/OStatus-Overview-3.png">
    <p>Instead of repeatedly pulling new feed updates, we instead register to a webhook and get new updates pushed to us. This protocol is called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">PubSubHubbub (PuSH)</a>, and it allows us to get updates in real-time, but how do we send content back?</p>
</div></section>

<section class="slide"><div>
    <h2>OStatus Overview</h2>
    <img src="data/OStatus-Overview-4.png">
    <p>Finally to send content (ActivityStream entries) to another site, OStatus employs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon_(protocol)">Salmon</a>, a protocol for decentralised commentary.</p>
</div></section>

<section class="slide"><div>
    <h2>OStatus in summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>OStatus is a collection of standards for federated web micropublishing.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Atom feeds for <strong>publishing</strong> content.</li>
            <li>PuSH hubs for realtime <strong>distribution</strong> of new content.</li>
            <li>Salmon for decentralised <strong>commentary</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>But OStatus still has issues...</li>
    </ul>
</div></section>

<section class="slide"><div>
    <h2>OStatus issues</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="next">No <strong>official implementation</strong> (in comparison to Twitter) which makes for a fragmented user experience.</li>
        <li class="next">No <strong>'killer app'</strong> to stir adoption, just a set of protocols that *could* achieve microblogging</li>
        <li class="next">No content discovery through <strong>hashtags</strong>!</li>
    </ol>
</div></section>

<section class="slide"><div>
    <h2>The solution</h2>
    <ul>
        <span>BitWeav — a project to bring open distributed micropublishing to the masses:</span>
        <ol>
            <li class="next"><strong>Official implementation</strong>: Official desktop client that connects to a backend daemon (allows for self-hosting or SaaS setup)</li>
            <li class="next"><strong>Killer app</strong>: be the 'indie' Twitter, for open distributed micropublishing. The idea is to do one thing, and to do it well.</li>
            <li class="next"><strong>Hashtags</strong>: P2P publish-subscribe network based on <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~spyros/papers/PolderCast.pdf">PolderCast</a> for distributing messages on topics.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
</div></section>

<section class="slide"><div>
    <h2>Status</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The design is done</strong>: I've been working on BitWeav for <abbr title="As of Sep'13">six months now</abbr>, iterating through various designs. I wrote a 14 page <a href="/whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a> in July that outlined a flavour of BitWeav <i>without the web</i> and just <i>purely P2P</i>. Since then I've moved over to the web as the platform.</li>
        <li><strong>The implementation is in progress</strong>: Both the backend daemon and graphical client are in development on <a href="https://github.com/BitWeav">GitHub</a>, and are populated with development tasks. The graphical client is a desktop web app using node-webkit and AngularJS, and the backend daemon is a Ruby gem. I am currently implementing the graphical client, heading around 50%.</li>
    </ul>

<section class="slide"><div>
    <h2>I need help</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I've been working on BitWeav in conjunction with being a full-time iB student, and am spending the majority of my spare time building this. If I were to receive any help whatsoever it would be <strong>well appreciated</strong>.</li>
        <li>If you're a <strong>programmer</strong> wanting to develop BitWeav, a <strong>designer</strong> that can help improve the UX of the graphical client, a <strong>marketer</strong>/person that can refine my pitch, or a <strong>hacker</strong> willing to discuss any constructive criticisms, do send me an email at <a href="mailto:liamzebedee@yahoo.com.au">liamzebedee@yahoo.com.au</a>.</li>
