<h2>What is BitWeav?</h2>
<p>BitWeav offers threaded microblogging (like Twitter) and encrypted private text, audio and video chat (like Skype), but with three significant advantages to its design:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Decentralised and <abbr title="Peer-to-peer">P2P</abbr></strong> — the BitWeav microblogging network is constructed entirely from those who use it. Instead of relying on another company's servers to store content, an approach vulnerable to censorship, comprimise of security and loss of privacy, each user controls their own profile. The BitWeav software socialises with other users automatically to distribute content that they are both intereted in. 
<li><strong>Security</strong> — every message you send and receive from other people is guaranteed to be entirely secure, meaning that you know it has full integrity and is completely authentic. Private communications are also encrypted from other third parties eavesdropping (like the NSA).
<li><strong>Reliability</strong> — the usability and security of BitWeav is not for comprimise, a principle for present and future. BitWeav is a free and open-source project, meaning that you are entitled to the product for free and have access to the source code so that you may modify, study, improve and share your modifications (so everyone may benefit).
</ol>

<h3>For hackers.</h3>
<p>BitWeav uses a fantastic new design for a publish-subscribe overlay network, called PolderCast. </p>
<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<p>My name is <a href="http://liamz.co/about">Liam Edwards-Playne</a>, I'm a 16 year old student at the Academy for Science, Maths and Technology. I've been programming for 5 years now, and have been involved in peer-to-peer for two of those.</p>
<p>I'm passionate about this project because I think it has the potential to make substantial change in the communications space. Aside from this I also have a need for BitWeav for my own personal use. My main issue is demonstrating my vision to others. Nonetheless I follow the quote: <q>Be the change you want to see in this world.</q></p>

<h2>Roadmap.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Complete the basic design for the website and verify that people understand the project/vision.</p>
<li><p>Decide on how we are going to employ WebRTC and Ruby to build a desktop app.</p>
<li><p>Implement the microblogging aspect of BitWeav.</p>
<li><p>Implement private messaging.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Helping out.</h2>
<p>Read the <a href="/july-2013/whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a>.</p>
<p>The people we need are:
<ul>
<li><p>Programmers who can help build the premier desktop implementation.</p>
<li><p>Designers who can help with graphical user interface design, user experience and such.</p>
</ul>
