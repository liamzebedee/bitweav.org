<h2 id="intro"><a href="#intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p class="lead">BitWeav is the first open micropublishing network that is built entirely by those who use it.</p>
<p>It's a peer-to-peer network of people (think BitTorrent) that work together using the BitWeav software to distribute updates
    to eachother on topics (profiles, hashtags, threads), in contrast to existing systems which host and control the entirety of their ecosystems.</p>
<p>Think of BitWeav as the indie alternative to Twitter, with features like:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Freedom</strong> — There is no censorship and there are no restrictions imposed on you, as the network is not controlled by anyone.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Privacy</strong> — You maintain control over your own data, and no personal details are needed to get started. There is no advertising either.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Hashtags</strong> — You can use hashtags to categorise messages, and you can follow any number of topics.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Multilingual support</strong> — Unlike others, BitWeav supports the exchange of messages in various languages and scripts.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Strong legality</strong> — You are assured that you only participate in distributing messages on topics you're interested in,
        unlike other P2P networks which make you support the entire network.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Open and free</strong> — You can rely on the functionality and security of BitWeav because its and open design and an open-source implementation.
        Anyone can improve the software, or even build their own apps on top of it.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="roadmap"><a href="#roadmap">Roadmap</a></h2>
<p>BitWeav's theoretical design was completed as a <a href="/whitepaper.pdf" title="Read the BitWeav whitepaper">whitepaper</a> in July 2013.
    Now it's being implemented by <a href="http://liamz.co/about">Liam Edwards-Playne</a>.</p>
<p>As of September 2013, I am currently implementing the <a href="https://github.com/bitweav/BitWeav">graphical client</a>.
    After this is done, work shall commence on the <a href="https://github.com/bitweav/bitweavd">backend daemon</a>.
</p>
<h4>Help wanted</h4>
<p>It is hard to put a date on a first release. I'm currently engaged in completing my iB diploma, among other things, so I am short on time.</p>
<p>I am seeking assitance from:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Programmers: for helping with the implementation of the daemon (Ruby) and/or graphical client (HTML/CSS/JS + AngularJS).</li>
    <li>Designers: for consulting on how to improve the user experience of the graphical client.</li>
    <li>Marketers: for refining the pitch of the project.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-is-this-different-to"><a href="#how-is-this-different-to">How is this different to?</a></h2>
<h4>Trsst</h4>
<p>Trsst is an idea for distributed social networking that uses HTTP to securely relay RSS feed updates.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Doesn't support autonomous discovery of content, through hashtags and such.</li>
    <li>Has no concept of replies or threads.</li>
    <li>Doesn't have any specification or defined protocol.</li>
    <li>Appears to be propietary and closed-source.</li>
</ul>

<h4>OStatus/Identica</h4>
<p>OStatus is an open web protocol for distributed micropublishing, that's built upon open standards for real-time social feeds (Atom, ActivityStreams, PubSubHubBub).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Doesn't support autonomous discovery of content, through hashtags and such.</li>
    <li>Has no official or 'de facto' implementation.</li>
    <li>Messages are not authenticated.</li>
    <li>OStatus is a web protocol, which means it is accompanied by the complexities of HTTP.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tent + microblogging</h4>
<p>Tent is a protocol for open, decentralized social networking that uses a combination of HTTP and JSON to relay app-specific data between different users.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Doesn't support autonomous discovery of content, through hashtags and such.</li>
    <li>Doesn't appear to have multilingual support</li>
    <li>Is a more generic protocol in comparison to BitWeav, which is optimised for micropublishing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Diaspora + microblogging</h4>
<p>Diaspora is an open web protocol and software for distributed social networking.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Doesn't support autonomous discovery of content, through hashtags and such.</li>
    <li>Is a more generic protocol in comparison to BitWeav, which is optimised for micropublishing.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="other-questions"><a href="#other-questions">Other questions</a></h2>
<h4>Why are you doing this?</h4>
<p>I have many reasons for building BitWeav, but the main one is this. Researching, innovating and building something that the world has never seen before is the most spectacular thing. The idea that people might use it and I might have some small impact on the world of technology and P2P just motivates me more.</p>
<p>Aside from this, among the flurry of P2P alternatives to applications that have been established during 2013 (after Bitcoin/PRISM went mainstream), there is a large unfulfilled void where a P2P micropublishing platform should be. There have been at most only a couple of good pieces of development into this area, among them being <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/iptps09/tech/full_papers/sandler/sandler_html/" rel="nofollow">FETHR</a> and <a href="http://tent.io" rel="nofollow">Tent</a>. This quote explains my challenge: <q>Centralised protocols exist where P2P protocols can't.</q></p>

<h4>What if BitWeav fails because of no-one using it / spam / X?</h4>
<p>I'm building BitWeav because I like doing stuff like this. While it's highly unlikely that it doesn't catch on, I'm not worried because I'll have the satisfaction knowing that I've laid the foundations for future development in this area (and that to me is success).</p>

<h4>What if people use it for bad?</h4>
<p><q>One does not find solutions to political problems in cryptography.</q></p>
