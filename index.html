<h2>What is BitWeav?</h2>
<p>BitWeav offers threaded microblogging (like Twitter), but with three significant advantages to its design:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Decentralised and <abbr title="Peer-to-peer">P2P</abbr></strong> — the BitWeav microblogging network is constructed entirely from those who use it. Instead of relying on another company's servers to store content, an approach vulnerable to censorship, compromise of security and loss of privacy, each user controls their own profile. The BitWeav software socialises with other users automatically to distribute content that they are both interested in. 
<li><strong>Security</strong> — every message you send and receive from other people is guaranteed to be entirely secure, meaning that you know it has full integrity and is completely authentic. Private communications are also encrypted from other third parties eavesdropping (like the NSA).
<li><strong>Reliability</strong> — the usability and security of BitWeav is not for compromise, a principle for present and future. BitWeav is a free and open-source project, meaning that you are entitled to the product for free and have access to the source code so that you may modify, study, improve and share your modifications (so everyone may benefit).
</ol>
<p>BitWeav is a decentralised replacement for a number of technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RSS Feeds</strong> — <p></p>
<li><strong>Torrent indexers</strong> — <p></p>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> — <p></p>
<li><strong>IRC networks</strong> — <p></p>
</ul>

<h3>For hackers.</h3>
<p>BitWeav uses a fantastic new design for a publish-subscribe overlay network, called PolderCast. PolderCast facilitates publishing without rendez-vous nodes, which means that when you publish a message on a topic, it is only those nodes who are interested that receive it. The subscribe mechanism is no longer explicit — nodes subscribe to topics simply by connecting to those nodes who are already subscribed.</p>
<p>Aside from this, BitWeav employs a number of novel incentive mechanisms to improve user experience on the network.</p>
<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<p>My name is <a href="http://liamz.co/about">Liam Edwards-Playne</a>, I'm a 16 year old student at the Academy for Science, Maths and Technology. I've been programming for 5 years now, and have been involved in peer-to-peer for two of those.</p>
<p>I'm passionate about this project because I think it has the potential to make substantial change in the communications space. Aside from this I also have a need for BitWeav for my own personal use. My main issue is demonstrating my vision to others. Nonetheless I follow the quote: <q>Be the change you want to see in this world.</q></p>

<h2>Roadmap.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Complete the basic design for the website and verify that people understand the project/vision.</p>
<li><p>Decide on how we are going to employ WebRTC and Ruby to build a desktop app.</p>
<li><p>Implement the microblogging aspect of BitWeav.</p>
<li><p>Implement private messaging.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Helping out.</h2>
<p>Read the <a href="/july-2013/whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a>.</p>
<p>The people we need are:
<ul>
<li><p>Programmers who can help build the premier desktop implementation.</p>
<li><p>Designers who can help with graphical user interface design, user experience and such.</p>
</ul>
</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/bitweav/bitweav">Github repository</a>.</p>

<span>BitWeav is undergoing some design changes, which involve rewriting certain sections of the whitepaper, and thus the project is not ready for public review. If you are interested in the project, please contact me at </span><img title="My email address" src="/data/liamz-email.png"></img>.
